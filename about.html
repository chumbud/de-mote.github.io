                    <div class="description">I'm a designer from New Jersey who currently attends Rutgers University: New Brunswick. During my time here at Rutgers I've been studying Information Technology and Informatics, focusing on web design and user experience.
                         <br><br>
                         My start in design was back in 2006 during the start of my middle school career when I was gifted my first tablet--the drawing kind, not the touch kind. With that I also recieved a copy of Macromedia Studio 8 where I had been given the opportunity to learn Fireworks and Flash. I initially started with animation, making whatever I wanted and gave it life through motion. By the time I was in high school I had a large portfolio of animated pieces that I was proud of but now slightly embarrassed of in retrospect. During the dark ages of puberty, I moved into design, learning Indesign, Illustrator and Photoshop--trying to learn whatever I could just to have fun.
                         <br><br>It wasn't until freshman year of college that I started learning code. I can't say it was the easiest transition for a designer, but once I got the hang of it just making an animated button on the first iteration of my portfolio gave me goosebumps. (Yea, actually) It was then that I learned that code could add several levels of depth to a design past visual identity.
                         <br><br>
                         Now in my senior year, plans are always changing and I'm still trying to find out what I want to do with the rest of my life both on a personal and career level. The one thing that never changes is that I love to create, whether it was with legos as a child or animation back in high school. My goal is to belong somewhere where I can have control over what I make and give it life through interactivity. Every detail is important to me and I strive to delivery work that I can be proud of.</div>
