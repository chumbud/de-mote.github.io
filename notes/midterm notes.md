##Midterm Notes

### 1. Information Behavior

**Kulthau:** information seeking is divided into 6 stages, seen by common information process and emotion patterns. Initiation, recognizing need for information Selection, selecting general topic, Exploration, investigating the topic, Formulation, resolves conflicting inormation and verifying hypothesises/develops a forcused topic, Collection, gathering information based off of the focused topic found in formulation, Presentation, concluding stage of final searches, finding redundent info or of diminishing relevance

**Berry Picking Model:** Forming a query, scanning results, picking what is relevant and repeat

**Wilson:** stated that information-seeking was prompted by an individualâ€™s physiological, cognitive, or affective needs, which have their roots in personal factors, role demands, or environmental context.[6] In order to satisfy these needs, an individual makes demands upon a system by acting as an intermediary, or through the use of technology.

**Zipf:** Principle of least effort: individuals will adopt course of action that will involve least amount of effort.
	Someone asks nearest coworker or artist uses nearest tools

Myths:
Only objective info is important.
More info is better

###2. Search Engine Query

**Boolean Operators:** AND OR NOT

parts of a search query is a term, lol

```
DOGS OR CATS, A/B
DOGS AND CATS AB
DOGS NOT CATS A-B
```

	"" exact phrase match
	() processes inside term first

Different user base which makes a different page ranking.

Different search engines have differing crawling/indexing methods, differing search algorithms, some use personalized search results based off users' past history/interests/profiles.

different databases, different filtering strategies in queries,
### 3. How Search Engine Optimization


**Crawling:** sending out crawlers in order to find websites to index
	figures out what kind of information is on the web page, output format in XML, spits out what information is found on the page.
**Indexing:** means to actually store a page in a database

**Querying:** forming a query to use as a term of input
Retrieving: using a term or set of terms as input into a search engine to retrieve results related to that query

changing wording or grammar may increase results because search engines don't entirely know what you're trying to say. so trial and error of a certain query worded in different ways will retrieve different results.

**White hat:**

**Black hat:**
boost rankings by posting on blogs links of the site you're trying to boost in order to fool the search engine crawlers into thinking that the site is popular
doorway pages, pages that are served to search engines in order to skew page ranking or actual content given and giving a different page to users.
keyword stuffing: repeating keywords to try and up page rankings.
tiny text/hidden text/hidden liinks


**Inverted index:** it's a data structure that stores the the locations of certain terms.

### 4. Deep Web, Databases, Evaluating Electronic

**Why are some sites invisible?**

- Sites can include in their meta tags that they don't wanna be indexed.
- Crawlers can't index items inside of a database because they can't form queries to access these database.
	- These indexed pages are dynamically made so they also cannot be indexed
- Web sites you need to log into
- Live content
