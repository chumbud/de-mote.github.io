##Midterm Notes

### 1. Information Behavior

**Kulthau:** information seeking is divided into 6 stages, seen by common information process and emotion patterns.

- **I**nitiation, recognizing need for information.

- **S**election, selecting general topic.

- **E**xploration, investigating the topic.

- **F**ormulation, resolves conflicting inormation and verifying hypothesises/develops a forcused topic.

- **C**ollection, gathering information based off of the focused topic found in formulation.

- **P**resentation, concluding stage of final searches, finding redundent info or of diminishing relevance.

**Berry Picking Model:** Forming a query, scanning results, picking what is relevant and repeat

**Wilson:** stated that information-seeking was prompted by an individualâ€™s physiological, cognitive, or affective needs, which have their roots in personal factors, role demands, or environmental context.[6] In order to satisfy these needs, an individual makes demands upon a system by acting as an intermediary, or through the use of technology.

**Zipf:** Principle of least effort: individuals will adopt course of action that will involve least amount of effort.
	Someone asks nearest coworker or artist uses nearest tools

Myths:
1. Only objective info is important.
2. More info is better.
3. Information can only be acquired through formal sources.
4. There is relevant information for every need.
5. Every need sitaution has a solution.

###2. Search Engine Query

**Boolean Operators:** AND OR NOT

parts of a search query is a term, lol

```
DOGS OR CATS, A/B
DOGS AND CATS AB
DOGS NOT CATS A-B
```

	"" exact phrase match
	() processes inside term first

Different user base which makes a different page ranking.

Different search engines have differing crawling/indexing methods, differing search algorithms, some use personalized search results based off users' past history/interests/profiles.

different databases, different filtering strategies in queries,
### 3. How Search Engine Optimization


**Crawling:** sending out crawlers in order to find websites to index
	figures out what kind of information is on the web page, output format in XML, spits out what information is found on the page.

**Indexing:** means to actually store a page in a database. process of identifying and transforming the terms or words in a document. Looks for metadata as well to be apart of the index. Excludes stop words and root words as well when indexing terms in text. Indexing may also assign weights to terms in a document based on how often they occur in a document.

After a document is indexed the content is added to the index and works as an inverted index, where pages are indexed based on the terms that were on the documents. Saves time and improves accuracy.

**Querying:** forming a query to use as a term of input. terms are matched to the inverted index. booleans can be used.

**Retrieving:** using a term or set of terms as input into a search engine to retrieve results related to that query

Can be determined by:
Link based: where the more links the 'better' the site is
Click based: where rank is based off of how many clicks the site got in a search result.
Term based: how often the term appears on the web page.
Personalization...

**Display:** Showing results, and displaying snippets and showing where the terms from the query are shown.

changing wording or grammar may increase results because search engines don't entirely know what you're trying to say. so trial and error of a certain query worded in different ways will retrieve different results.

**Inverted index:** it's a data structure that stores the the locations of certain terms.

**White hat:** ethical approach to optimizing a site for a search engine by focusing on relevancy and organic ranking. it focuses on human audiences as opposed to search engines and follows all guidelines and policies search engines have.

Maile Ohye from the Google Webmasters video suggests white-hat practices to boost rankings in search engines.

- The first is working on site design strategy and understanding the needs of users with focus on user experience from when they land on a child page from a Google search. One needs to make sure that the site communicates how to navigate it's site from any page a user could land on from results.
- The second is loading time, loading time affects the bounce rate of users, any site that takes more than two seconds to load statistically drives users away therefore leading to a high bounce rate.
- Sites should have meta data, titles, descriptions, tags, keywords in order for the search engines to know what terms your site is related to.
- Optimized and fast error free sites
- Good quality content on the site.

**Black hat:** Goes against policy and protocols set by search engines. Pushes sites that deserve to be on the top of page results for a short period of time but then result in a ban when admins find out about their tactics.

- **Doorway pages:** a set of web pages, each of which is optimized for a particular keyword. Each page redirects users to web page designed for humans.

- **Keyword stuffing:** repeating keywords to try and up page rankings. tiny text/hidden text/hidden links

- **Cloaking:**  technique that shows one set of Web pages to search engines and another to human users.

- **Blog ping:** attracts search engine spiders to boost rankings by posting on blogs links of the site you're trying to boost in order to fool the search engine crawlers into thinking that the site is popular




### 4. Deep Web, Databases, Evaluating Electronic

**Why are some sites invisible?**

- Sites can include in their meta tags that they don't wanna be indexed.
- Crawlers can't index items inside of a database because they can't form queries to access these database.
	- These indexed pages are dynamically made so they also cannot be indexed
- Web sites you need to log into
- Live content


- accuracy and currency
	- **accuracy:** how reliable is the information? are there mispellings, grammar mistakes? can similar facts be found anywhere else? are there citations? does the site explain how data was found? is there a biblography?
	- **currency:**  is the content made within the past year or so? does the author state how often the information is updated?
- authority/credibility
	- **authority:** who is responsible for this page? is the author recognized for the subject they talkin about? is there a way to contact the author? does the author list and credientials? extensions?
	- **credibility:**
- quality
	-
- purpose/objectivity
	- **purpose:**
	- **objectivity:** does the author present a point that is from an objective stand point and is completely unbiased? does the site contain advertising? does copyright belong to a person or organization? where is funding coming from?
- coverage and relevance.
	- **coverage:** does the author present both sides of the story os a piece missing? is the information comprehensive enough for your needs? is the site too general? is the approach objective?
	- **relevance:**
