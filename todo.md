- if i really wanna, make the banner longer to only transition on biggg resolutions
- remove "animation" in header lol
- description space on bottom is uh.. scaling vertically with window size
- revise descriptions
- redo resume
- optimize about and contact for mobile
- get originals of my face from work

- for web layouts, make their own page and just have a scroll down to preview
- think about updating resume


-consider doing how that guys portfolio was and to give more screen space to the page have the banner scroll when scrolling down
-not sure what to with the side bar. maybe lay it under the banner and keep it the height of the page while the banner scrolls off of it?
-PARALAXXXXXX
